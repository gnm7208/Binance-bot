# Research Log

Daily morning research entries appended below.

---

## 2026-07-10 — Morning Research

### Account Snapshot
- **BLOCKED:** Binance API returned HTTP 451 ("restricted location") on account/positions/orders — could not verify live state.
- Perplexity also unavailable (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY empty) — used WebSearch fallback for all market research.
- Last known state (TRADE-LOG Day 0 baseline): $10,000 USDT, 0 positions, 0/3 trades this week.
- ClickUp alert sent re: API outage.

### Market Context
- BTC: ~$62,650 (+1.9% 24h), market cap $1.27T
- BTC Dominance: ~56% (near one-month high; capital consolidating in BTC, not rotating to alts)
- Fear & Greed Index: 22-26 (Extreme Fear) per most sources; one outlier reads 45 (Neutral)
- DXY: ~100.7-101, dollar firm on Middle East safe-haven demand; forecasts see DXY climbing toward 103.6 by year-end
- Fed: funds rate steady 3.50-3.75% under new Chair Warsh; July FOMC odds ~79.5% hold, ~19.4% hike — soft jobs data cooling near-term hike fears
- Macro notes: digital-asset legislation hopes for Senate action; BTC spot ETFs snapped a 10-day, $2.7B outflow streak with $221.7M inflow
- Sector leaders: AI/GameFi altcoins (Bittensor, Autonolas) leading on narrative strength despite broad Extreme Fear; RWA tokenization (Solana RWA ATH $3.41B); DeFi maturing toward institutional infra

### On-Chain / Derivatives
- Exchange flows: BTC ETF inflows resumed ($221.7M July 2) after $2.7B outflow streak
- Funding rates: BTC funding ~0.0087% (moderate, no euphoria)
- Open interest: ~$47.71B, down from ~368k BTC to ~342-346k BTC in early July — OI falling while price rises = short squeeze, not fresh conviction buying

### News on Held Positions
- N/A — no open positions (bot has not yet made its first trade)

### Trade Ideas
1. No high-conviction setup today — BTC dominance rising (56%) while Fear & Greed sits in Extreme Fear is a mixed signal; move looks like a short squeeze (falling OI) rather than confirmed trend. Wait for confirmation before first deployment.
2. Watch AI/GameFi altcoin narrative (e.g. Bittensor/TAO) for a pullback entry if momentum holds and a clean catalyst emerges.
3. Watch Solana RWA strength as a secondary theme if BTC dominance rolls over and alts catch a bid.

### Risk Factors
- Cannot verify account/position state — trading blind on capital allocation is unacceptable per Buy-Side Gate; do not trade until Binance API access is restored.
- Extreme Fear + falling open interest suggests current BTC strength is short-covering, not durable trend — chasing here risks a fast reversal.
- DXY strength forecast to continue into H2 2026 — headwind for risk assets broadly.
- Fed hike optionality (19.4% priced) not fully off the table — macro uncertainty into next FOMC.

### Decision
HOLD — no trade today. Binance API inaccessible (HTTP 451), so account/position state cannot be confirmed; buy-side gate cannot be satisfied. Re-check API access before morning-execution.

## 2026-07-16 — Morning Research (via morning-execution, research entry missing)

### Account Snapshot
- **BLOCKED**: Binance API returned HTTP 451 "Service unavailable from a restricted location" on `account`, `positions`, `orders` — confirmed via direct curl to `/api/v3/ping`, same 451 geo-restriction message. Identical failure to 2026-07-11, unresolved for 5 days.
- Last known state (Day 0 baseline, TRADE-LOG.md, unchanged since no trades ever executed): $10,000.00 USDT, 100% cash, 0 open positions.
- Trades this week: 0/3.
- ClickUp alert sent naming the outage.

### Market Context (WebSearch fallback — Perplexity key not set)
- BTC: ~$65,244 (24h % change not confirmed via this source)
- BTC Dominance: ~56% (Jul 9 reading, most recent available)
- Fear & Greed Index: 36 (Fear) per one tracker; readings range 22-46 across providers — treat as Fear-leaning, not confirmed
- No DXY / macro / on-chain data pulled — execution is blocked regardless, so full research sweep skipped.

### On-Chain / Derivatives
- Not pulled — account API blocked, no position-specific need; skipped given execution is impossible today.

### News on Held Positions
- None — 0 open positions.

### Trade Ideas
- None generated — cannot verify account state, quotes, spreads, or place orders while Binance API is geo-blocked.

### Risk Factors
- **Binance API geo-blocked (451) from this execution environment for 5+ consecutive days (2026-07-11 → 2026-07-16). Highest-priority operational risk — no execution capability at all until resolved.**
- PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not set in this environment — research quality degraded to WebSearch fallback even once trading resumes.
- Fear & Greed near "Fear" territory — sentiment fragile.

### Decision
TRADE: none. HOLD — mandatory: Binance API unreachable (451), cannot verify account state, quotes, or place/manage orders. ClickUp alert sent. This is the second consecutive blocked session since 2026-07-11; recommend escalating environment/network-egress configuration outside the bot's control.

## 2026-07-11 — Morning Research

### Account Snapshot
- **BLOCKED**: `bash scripts/binance.sh account/positions/orders` all returned HTTP 451
  ("Service unavailable from a restricted location according to 'b. Eligibility'") from
  every api*.binance.com host tried (api, api1, api2, api3, api-gcp) — the cloud
  environment's outbound IP is geo-restricted for private/signed Binance endpoints.
  Public data mirror (data-api.binance.vision) still works, used for market prices below.
- Per Trade Log: still Day 0, no positions opened yet, so no open-position exposure to
  verify — but position count / cash / weekly trade count cannot be confirmed from here.
- Trades this week: 0/3 (per Trade Log, no entries yet)

### Market Context
- BTC: $63,008 (-0.55% 24h) — live pull from data-api.binance.vision
- ETH: $1,759.48 (-1.15% 24h) — live pull from data-api.binance.vision
- BTC Dominance: ~55.5-56.2% (sources vary; stablecoin-adjusted would run a few pts higher)
- Fear & Greed Index: ~22-24 (Extreme Fear)
- DXY: ~100.9, holding below 101 — softer June NFP (+57k vs 110k expected) cut Fed hike
  odds, pressuring dollar and supporting risk assets incl. crypto
- Macro notes: Weak labor data reduced Sept rate-hike odds to ~50% (from ~66%); real wages
  negative (3.5% nominal earnings vs 4.2% CPI) keeps Fed's Warsh boxed in on dovish easing;
  July 29 FOMC is next major catalyst
- Sector leaders: DeFi firming (AAVE +9% wk, strongest Ethereum new-wallet day since 2021,
  ~$12.2B TVL) despite broader weakness. L1s weakest narrative, -22.8% in Q2. AI tokens
  mixed (TAO, FET, ICP cited as leaders) but breadth poor (21 gainers/35 losers). Gaming
  narrow/momentum-driven (BEAT +112% on burn news, not broad strength).
- Note: initial WebSearch pass for BTC price returned a conflicting $99,887/+4.18% figure
  from a low-quality source — discarded in favor of the direct Binance public-data pull
  above, which is authoritative.

### On-Chain / Derivatives
- Spot BTC ETFs: snapped 10-day, $2.7B outflow streak with +$221.7M inflow (largest daily
  haul in 2 months), timed with the soft payrolls print
- BTC funding rates: ~0.0087%, moderate — fresh leverage building, no euphoria
- Open interest: ~$47.7B; short liquidations ($86.6M) outweighing longs ($54.0M), i.e.
  shorts getting squeezed on the bounce

### News on Held Positions
- None — no open positions (Day 0)

### Trade Ideas
No trade ideas this session — account state (cash, position count, weekly trade count)
cannot be verified due to the Binance API access blocker above, so the buy-side gate
cannot be evaluated regardless of setup quality. DeFi (AAVE) is the strongest momentum
sector today and worth first look once account access is restored.

### Risk Factors
- Binance private/signed API endpoints are geo-blocked (HTTP 451) from this environment —
  hard blocker on account state, execution, and stop management until resolved
  (proxy/network config or environment IP change needed)
- Fear & Greed at extreme fear (~22) — contrarian bounce signal but also reflects real
  downside risk/volatility
- Sentiment/price data conflicting across sources today — cross-check before acting
- July 29 FOMC and pending CLARITY Act / XRP catalyst could move the market sharply

### Decision
TRADE: none. HOLD — mandatory: Binance API unreachable (451), cannot verify account state or place/manage orders. Escalated via ClickUp. Re-run research/execution once connectivity is confirmed restored.

## 2026-07-19 — Morning Research

### Account Snapshot
- **BLOCKED**: `BYBIT_API_KEY` and `BYBIT_SECRET_KEY` are **empty in the cloud routine environment** — `scripts/bybit.sh` aborts before any request. No account, positions, orders, or stop visibility. Cannot place/cancel/manage orders.
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` also empty → research done via WebSearch fallback (no Perplexity).
- Last known state (Day 0 baseline, TRADE-LOG): $10,000.00 USDT, 100% cash, 0 open positions. **Still 0 trades placed on Day 8** — system has never been able to execute since launch (Binance 451 → migrated to Bybit → creds not configured).

### Market Context
- BTC: ~$64,376 (roughly flat 24h; mid-July range ~$63,900–$64,900)
- ETH: ~$1,840 (−0.75% 24h, laggard)
- BTC Dominance: ~56–60% (≈57% consensus)
- Total crypto market cap: ~$2.19T
- Fear & Greed: mixed across providers 22–54 — **Fear-leaning (~25–40)**, driven by geopolitics, thin volume, pending US inflation data
- DXY: ~100.6–100.9 (firm but easing from early-July ~101.4 highs)
- Macro: FOMC Jul 28–29 — ~65% priced for **hold** at 3.50–3.75%; weak June payrolls (57k) pushed any hike odds to September; risk-neutral backdrop
- Sector leaders: alts **stabilizing but no altseason** — BTC still commands flows; SOL = risk-on tell (watch for SOL outperformance as fear-easing signal); ETH ETFs +$36.7M small inflows
- Catalyst: CLARITY Act (market-structure bill) optimism lifting BTC/ETH/XRP sentiment

### On-Chain / Derivatives
- Funding: near-neutral/mildly positive (~0.003%) — leverage washed out vs early-2026 froth; low cascade risk
- Open interest: BTC futures ~$48.9B (+3.5%), balanced positioning
- ETF flows: recent 2-day +$191M bounce reversing a 10-day −$2.73B streak; **net outflows still dominate 7d/30d**
- On-chain: subdued retail demand, negative Coinbase premium, low chain activity → caution

### News on Held Positions
- None — 0 open positions.

### Trade Ideas
_No executable ideas — account is unreachable (empty Bybit creds). Watchlist only, pending fixed connectivity + live quotes:_
1. SOL — thesis: first mover if fear eases / altseason builds; risk-on proxy. Enter only on confirmed BTC-relative strength. Levels TBD on live quotes.
2. ETH — thesis: ETF inflows resuming, stablecoin/RWA platform narrative; but currently a laggard. Wait for reclaim of relative strength vs BTC.
3. BTC — thesis: dominance high + low leverage = cleanest risk-on vehicle if CLARITY Act catalyst lands. Default beta.

### Risk Factors
- **Bybit credentials not set in cloud routine env — top operational risk.** The entire bot cannot trade; morning-execution (9 AM) will fail. 8 days live, still $0 deployed. Escalating via ClickUp.
- Fear-leaning sentiment + choppy range-bound BTC — no strong directional edge
- Net ETF outflows / subdued retail — demand-side weakness
- DXY firm + hawkish-lean Fed — risk-asset headwind
- Thin summer volume amplifies whipsaw

### Decision
TRADE: none. HOLD — mandatory: Bybit API credentials missing from cloud environment; cannot verify account or place/manage orders. Even absent the outage, sentiment is Fear-leaning with no clear edge → HOLD is the correct discretionary call. Fix credential configuration before 9 AM execution routine.
